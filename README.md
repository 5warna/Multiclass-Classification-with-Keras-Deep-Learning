# Multiclass-Classification-with-Keras-Deep-Learning
## Deep Learning Project in Python with Keras in Multiclass Classification Healthcare Dataset

Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models.
It is part of the TensorFlow library and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.
It is easy-to-use Neural Network Library written in Python that runs at top of Theano or Tensorflow. Tensorflow provides low-level as well as high-level API, indeed Keras only provide High-level API.

### Dataset Description
This is a multi-class classification problem, meaning that there are more than two classes to be predicted. In fact, there are seven classes in the outcome column. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Classification Final). Predictor variables includes age, sex, patient type, different pregnancy-related situations, patients with various conditions, and more.

### We can summarize the construction of deep learning models in Keras as follows:
- Define your model: Create a sequence and add layers.
- Compile your model: Specify loss functions and optimizers.
- Fit your model: Execute the model using data.
- Evaluate your model: Evaluate the model on training dataset
- Make predictions. Use the model to generate predictions on new data.
